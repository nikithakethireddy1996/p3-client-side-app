                        <p>
            
                            I had completed my bachelors of degree with the background of computer science. 
                            I had worked some projects based on excel. I think the knowledge I gained during
                            my degree and through the projects i have done is not sufficient enough for me to
                            achieve my goal in real world practise.Currently the only goal I have is to gain 
                            more and more knowledge in programming languages so that it would lead me to build
                            a great career. I would like to see myself developing a web pages and just bring 
                            them into the IT world.
                            
                        
                            <br>I love to do tiktok videos and  I spend my leisure time by doing those. I love 
                            to post those videos and entertain the people. Apart from that I spend most of the 
                            leisure time watching Korean Dramas too.

                            In the future I hope I would like to see myself developing a web pages and just bring 
                            them into the IT world. There is also a project which I want to develop in the future
                            and this project can be developed only if I gain loads of skills. I hope i would develop
                            all the skills required for developing my dream project.

                        <h3>Family Background</h3>
                        <p>
                            I belong to a family where there are 12 members in my family.
                            You can call it as a joint family or a giant family. I love to
                            spend most of the time with my family but since i have come to 
                            do my masters i am just able to contact them through mobile and 
                            skype. My father works with a private Company. My mother is a 
                            homemaker. I have a brother who works as developer in the It field 
                            itself. However, my family also includes my mothers sisters and their
                            husbands and their children. We are living together since 10 years
                            and i want to stay with them forever.
